If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Here's more indepth data about the person's music listening preferences based on average energy, valence and danceability

ENERGY
Average energy of music is 0.65906

VALENCE
Average valence of music is 0.484443

DANCEABILITY
Average danceability of music is 0.71646

Conclusion:
The valence of music that the user listened to was average. Showing that the user listens to both happy and sad music. Hence, I would conclude the user is from the blue mood group. This person seeks out music to feel their feelings out loud.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The data from his top 100 songs, might not give accurate information of the user, we might need to have more data from what the user is listening to.
